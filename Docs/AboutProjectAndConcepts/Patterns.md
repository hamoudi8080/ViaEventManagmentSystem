# Result Patterns

## The Problem

### Using Exceptions: The Traditional Way

#### Advantages of Exceptions

- **Simplicity**: Throwing and catching exceptions is easy and built into the .NET framework.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Exceptions allow error handling to be separated from business logic, which can make the code cleaner.
- **Robust Framework Support**: The .NET framework has extensive support for exceptions, including various built-in exception types and the familiar try-catch-finally blocks.

#### Disadvantages of Exceptions

- **Performance Cost**: Exceptions can be expensive in terms of performance, especially if they are used for regular control flow.
- **Hidden Control Flow**: Exceptions can obscure the normal flow of the program, making the code harder to read and understand.
- **Risk of Unhandled Exceptions**: If exceptions are not properly managed, they can propagate and cause the application to crash.

## The Result Pattern: A More Explicit Approach

#### Advantages of the Result Pattern

- **Explicit Handling**: The result pattern makes error handling explicit, which can make the code more understandable and maintainable.
- **Better Testability**: It’s easier to write tests for both success and failure cases without relying on exceptions.
- **Avoids Uncaught Exceptions**: By using results instead of exceptions, you reduce the risk of unhandled exceptions causing crashes.

#### Disadvantages of the Result Pattern

- **Verbosity**: The result pattern can make the code more verbose because you need to check the result of every operation.
- **Mixed Concerns**: Business logic and error handling can become intertwined, which can make the code less readable.
