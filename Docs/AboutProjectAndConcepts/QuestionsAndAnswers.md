why do we use base class of value objects?
In domain-driven design (DDD), a Value Object represents a small, immutable object that holds a set of attributes but does not have an identity. A value object is concerned only with its attributes and not with any unique identity.
A base class for value objects in DDD usually provides essential functionality related to equality and immutability. The purpose of this base class is to ensure that value objects are compared based on their attributes rather than by reference, and they remain immutable once created.
- also instead of copy pasting the code through all value objects we just put it in abstract base class.

what is an entity ?
It represents an object in the system that has a distinct and unique identity.

what is aggregate?
An AGGREGATE is a cluster of associated objects that we treat as a unit for the purpose of data changes.

so the only way to change the data of the boundary must be through the aggregate root, because The aggregate root is responsible for enforcing business rules and ensuring data integrity within its boundary.

why an aggregate must have a boundary

An Aggregate must have a boundary to define the scope and limits of responsibility for its associated entities and value objects. This boundary plays a critical role in maintaining consistency, enforcing business rules, and simplifying system design.
